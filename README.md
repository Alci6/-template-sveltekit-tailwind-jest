## Boilerplate that you can delete
I use to delete /lib because I use a custom version of [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) template folder instead: 
* Components/
  * atoms/
  * molecules/
  * organisms/
  * pages/

I added a Button in ./src/components/atoms/ from Storybook to test that works with alias (dynamic path) and with tailwind (you can delete it)
